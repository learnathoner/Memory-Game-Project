# Udacity's Memory Game!

Welcome to my Memory Game project for Udacity, meant to use HTML, CSS, JS, and jQuery in building a simple interactive app. Check out the rules and instructions below:

## Getting Started:

You can load the game by going to: https://learnathoner.github.io/Memory-Game-Project/

## Objective and Rules

The objective is to match all the tiles in as few moves and time as possible!

The rules are pretty simple:

- Click a tile to flip it over and see the image
- Click on another tile to reveal that image
- If it's a match, they stay revealed, otherwise they hide again
- Each two clicks counts as a move

Once you win, the game will tell you your time, stars, and moves required!

**Note**: Clicking on the same tile twice will NOT count as a move. That's in case you accidentally click on the wrong tile. Yes, you can use that to cheat and see all the tiles without using moves... but don't.

## Options

- The **Reset** Button resets your moves, stars, and the timer, allowing you to start over
- After winning, the **Play Again** button will also restart the game
